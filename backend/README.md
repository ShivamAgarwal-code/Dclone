### There are 2 main components in this API.

REST refers to the REST API (uses HTTP).
WS refers to the WebSocket API (uses WS).

### Dependency Injection

Due to the nature of the DI used in this project, dependencies cannot be circular:

> rest/server.ts

```ts
import { WS } from '...';
...
Deps.get<WS>(WS);
```

> ws/websocket.ts

```ts
import { REST } from '...';
...
Deps.get<REST>(REST);
```

`Deps.add` -> create dep with custom object.
`Deps.get` -> get dep, or create with no args constructor.
